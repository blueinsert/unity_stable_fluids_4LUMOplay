I adpated my project unity_stable_fluids to LumoPlaySDK.
Replace the input from mouse or touch to Lumo's vision motion events.
And Add some new features, but the core is the same.
My origin project: https://github.com/blueinsert/unity_stable_fluids

LUMOplay is software that makes any digital display interactive. It's used by parents, teachers, businesses, agencies, and brands all over the world.

So,now you could make fluids moving by your body, not only the mouse.
